        <h2>Lome</h2>
        <img src="images/Lome.jpg" alt="Lome landscape">
        <p>Lome, city, capital of Togo. Lome lies on the Gulf of Guinea (Atlantic coast) in the
            extreme
            southwestern corner of the country. Selected as the colonial capital of German Togoland
            in 1897, it
            became important as an administrative, commercial, and transport centre. A modern town
            was laid out,
            and a 1,380-foot (420-metre) jetty was built to facilitate the export of raw materials.
            Three
            railways fan out from Lomé to the hinterland: northwest to kpalimé, north to Sokodé, and
            east along
            the coast to Aného. Modernization of the port was begun in the 1960s, and a deepwater
            harbour,
            completed in 1968, can handle some three million tons of goods annually. This has
            greatly
            facilitated the shipping of phosphates and other major exports, such as cocoa, coffee,
            copra,
            cotton, and palm products. Lome is also home to an international airport, thermal power
            plant, and
            the Maison du Peuple, a conference hall.</p>
